PyTorch: Custom nn Modules
--------------------------

A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer, trained to predict y from x
by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation defines the model as a custom Module subclass. Whenever you
want a model more complex than a simple sequence of existing Modules you will
need to define your model this way.
